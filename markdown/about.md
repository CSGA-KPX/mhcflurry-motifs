# About

This site gives information on MHC Class I alleles as predicted by
[MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry).

**The results are predictions, not experimentally-determined motifs.**
In some cases these will deviate from actual motifs. If you find a case of
egregious mismatch, please let us know by filing an
[issue](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry-motifs/issues).
This will help us improve MHCflurry in the future.

## Result generation
We are using the MHCflurry {{version}} binding affinity (BA) prediction to
generate these, not the presentation scores. This may change in the future.

For each allele, we took the top 1% predicted binders across a large set of random peptides.
The peptides were sampled using the amino acid frequencies of the peptides in the
MHCflurry training data.

For the sequence logos, we plotted the frequency of each amino acid after
normalizing by the overall rate of that amino acid in the training data.

The length distributions represent the fraction of the top 1% peptides that are
each length.

## Code
The predictions over the big pool of peptides are generated by the MHCflurry
[calibrate-percentile-ranks](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry/blob/master/mhcflurry/calibrate_percentile_ranks_command.py)
command.

The motif images and related analyses are part of the
[analysis_predictor_info](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry/blob/master/downloads-generation/analysis_predictor_info/generate_artifacts.py) 
MHCflurry download.

This site is generated in the [mhcflurry-motifs](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry-motifs)
GitHub project.
