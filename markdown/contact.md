## Issues
For cases where motifs appear to be substantially wrong, please file an issue on the
[mhcflurry-motifs](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry-motifs) GitHub
page. We can't address these immediately but will try to incorporate your
observations into a future version of MHCflurry.

For issues with MHCflurry as a software library, please file an issue on the
[MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry) repo.
